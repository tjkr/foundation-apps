<h2>Changelog</h2>
<h3 class="subheader">Foundation is open source and it can move fast. You can stay up to date with each new version here.</h3>

<h3>How to update</h3>

<p>If you're updating a project built with our template stack, the CLI will help you update:</p>

<hljs language="bash">
foundation-apps update
</hljs>

<p>It's also possible to update by hand. Open the <code>bower.json</code> and change your <code>foundation-apps</code> dependency to the version you want:</p>

<hljs language="json">
{
  "dependencies": {
    "foundation-apps": "1.0.3"
  }
}
</hljs>

<p>Save the file and then update with Bower:</p>

<hljs language="bash">
bower update
</hljs>

<h3>Version 1.0.3</h3>

<p><em>February 16, 2015</em></p>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>The Bower and npm packages now include a <code>dist</code> folder, which contains compiled CSS and JavaScript files, in minified and unminified flavors.</li>
<li>The Sass is now fully compatible with libsass. It's been tested in node-sass 1.2.3. Eventually our documentation and template stack will be compiled with node-sass instead of Ruby Sass, but we'll continue to test both.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Breaking Changes</h4>

<p>These Sass variables changed. If you're updating an existing project, you'll need to update your <code>_settings.scss</code> file manually.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Added:</strong> <code>$badge-diameter: 1.5rem</code></li>
<li><strong>Renamed:</strong> <code>$badge-font-color</code> is now <code>$badge-color</code></li>
<li><strong>Removed:</strong> <code>$badge-padding</code></li>
<li><strong>Removed:</strong> <code>$badge-radius</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The old variables are still in the codebase but aren't being used. They'll be permanently removed in version 1.1.</p>

<h4>Template Changes</h4>

<p>The Gulpfile used in the <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template">template stack</a> now uses the <code>gulp-load-plugins</code> library to streamline use of plugins. <strong>If you have an existing project, you don't need to change anything to upgrade.</strong></p>

<h4>New Features</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stacking notifications.</strong> (#388) Dynamically-called notifications will now stack when you call more than one.</li>
<li><strong>Responsive Iconic icons.</strong> (#408) Iconic icons are now fluid by default, which means they will adjust their geometry based on the width of the parent container.</li>
<li><strong>Staggered animations.</strong> (#394) When using our motion classes in conjunction with the <code>ng-repeat</code>, you can now add a stagger class to make items animate in sequence. Add the class <code>.stagger</code>, <code>.short-stagger</code>, or <code>.long-stagger</code> to an element to enable the stagger effect.</li>
<li>#376: Added <code>.info</code> and <code>.dark</code> coloring classes to buttons.</li>
<li>#436: The items in a menu bar can be aligned with <code>.align-right</code>, <code>.align-center</code>, <code>.align-justify</code>, or <code>.align-spaced</code>. These classes mimic the behavior of the grid alignment classes.</li>
<li>Notifications can now be assigned a timeout by adding the <code>autoclose</code> attribute. The value of <code>autoclose</code> is the number of milliseconds to wait before closing.</li>
<li>The speed of all animations has been increased slightly. The default felt just a <em>little</em> too slow.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<p><strong>CSS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>#194: Fixed modals not scrolling when they overflow their parent.</li>
<li>#412: <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements can be used as prefix/postfix elements in forms now, in addition to <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>#417: Added padding to <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements to prevent the text from overlapping with the arrow.</li>
<li>#435: Fixed a misnamed parameter in the <code>grid-block()</code> mixin.</li>
<li>#438: Fixed display issues with <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements in Firefox.</li>
<li>#453: Fixed block list checkboxes being misaligned.</li>
<li>Fixed the <code>.dialog</code> class and sizing classes of modals not working.</li>
<li>The CSS for badges was refactored so they're sized with width and height instead of padding.</li>
<li>The pointer cursor is now used when hovering over any anchor (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) or any element with the <code>ui-sref</code> attribute.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>#363: Fixed <code>zf-close</code> not working when placed outside of a component.</li>
<li>#420: Fixed panel/block animations triggering even though the element is in block mode.</li>
<li>#427: Fixed the <code>pin-at</code> directive not passing its value to Tether.</li>
<li>#448: Fixed invalid <code>$scope.params</code> property on the DefaultController controller.</li>
<li>If a component is closed or opened while a transition is in progress, the transition will reverse.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.0.2</h3>

<p><em>December 23, 2014</em></p>

<p><strong>Foundation for Apps is now on npm!</strong> <code>npm install foundation-apps</code></p>

<p><strong>Upgrading from an older version?</strong> We changed how our Angular plugins are structured, which means an existing app's build process will need to be changed slightly.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>If you're using our template stack as-is:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Replace your existing <code>Gulpfile.js</code> with the <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template/blob/master/gulpfile.js">new Gulpfile</a>.</li>
<li>Copy the <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template/blob/master/client/assets/js/app.js">new app.js</a> file into the folder <code>client/assets/js/</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you need to upgrade a project with a custom build process:
<ul>
<li>To capture every plugin's JavaScript files in a single blob, use <code>bower_components/foundation-apps/js/angular/**/*.js</code>.</li>
<li>The Bower package no longer includes an <code>app.js</code> file. You can use our template stack's file as a baseline to write your own.</li>
<li>To capture every plugin's HTML template, use <code>bower_components/foundation-apps/js/angular/components/**/*.html</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Codebase changes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>#282: The Angular code has been refactored to be more streamlined and more modular. Each UI component now has its own folder, which includes the component's JavaScript and HTML template. The template stack has been updated to properly compile the new asset structure. <strong>If you're upgrading an existing project, follow the above instructions to get everything set.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Bower package no longer includes an <code>app.js</code> file. Instead, a sample file has been included in the <code>client</code> folder of the template stack.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>#108: Every Sass function now has a unit test. Run <code>gulp sass:test</code> to run the test suite.</li>
<li>#338: The Sass settings file is now automatically generated based on the variables inside each component's Sass file, with the command <code>gulp settings</code>. The <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-settings-parser">settings parser plguin</a> will be maintained as a separate codebase. The plugin pulls the variables out of each Sass file, after which:
<ul>
<li>Every component's variables are combined into one settings file, organized by component.</li>
<li>Each individual component's variables are output as an HTML partial, to be displayed on that component's documentation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Touch support!</strong> We added the <a href="http://ryanmullins.github.io/angular-hammer/">Hammer.js Angular library</a> to our codebase, which allows you to trigger functions with touch gestures, using directives like <code>hm-swipeup</code> and <code>hm-pinchin</code>.
<ul>
<li>We added one custom directive, <code>zf-touch-close</code>, which allows you to trigger the <code>close</code> event on an element by swiping. We'll add more features in future versions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>#301: Menu bars can now switch between the expanded and condensed styles at different screen sizes, using these classes: <code>condense</code>, <code>medium-condense</code>, <code>large-condense</code>, <code>medium-expand</code>, <code>large-expand</code>.</li>
<li>#335: Menu bars can now be wrapped in a <code>menu-bar-group</code> container, which allows two menu bars to sit on the same row, aligned to the left and the right. Learn more <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/apps/docs/#!/menu-bar">here</a>.</li>
<li>#342: The <code>src</code> attribute of an Iconic icon can now be dynamically inserted. Instead of <code>data-src</code>, define the icon's source with the <code>dyn-src</code> attribute on a <code>zf-iconic</code> element.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.0.0 RC1 — Mont Blanc</h3>

<p>It's our 1.0 release candidate! Thanks for stopping by to take a look.</p>

<h4>How to mess with it</h4>

<p>If you want a quick way to jump in, check out our <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template">starter template</a>, which has a basic directory structure and a blank index file for you to work with. Follow the instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template/blob/master/readme.md">readme</a> to get going.</p>

<p>The first thing you'll probably want to check out is the grid. If you compile this repo on your machine, you can find the grid documentation at <a href="http://localhost:8080/#!/grid">http://localhost:8080/#!/grid</a>. You can also view the source of that file <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/blob/master/docs/templates/grid.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>To incorporate our Sass components and Angular directives into your own project, install Foundation using Bower:</p>

<hljs>
bower install zurb/foundation-apps
</hljs>

<p>The JavaScript is organized into common components, specific directives, and vendor files. There's also a sample `app.js` that shows how to import the Foundation modules, but you'll likely want to set up your Angular application your own way.</p>

<h4>How to contribute</h4>

<p>We love feedback! We have a few <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adiscussion">discussion topics</a> open on our issue tracker, but if you have more specific feedback, please open a new issue! If you encounter any bugs, let us know as well. Be sure to specify the browser and operating system you're using, and show us how we can recreate the issue. Code samples are great!</p>

<h4>What's left</h4>

<p>The codebase is very close to feature-complete. Here are the things we're still working on:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Fully-working motion classes (see #113)</li>
 <li>Loose ends on components (see #109, #110, #111)</li>
 <li>Animation on directives (see #107)</li>
 <li>Unit tests for Angular and Sass (see #106)</li>
 <li>A finished settings file</li>
 <li>The command-line interface (being built in a separate repo, currently private)</li>
 <li>Testing, testing, testing</li>
</ul>
